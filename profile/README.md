# Distribute Aid

Distribute Aid delivers humanitarian aid to communities in need.

By coordinating end-to-end shipments, we make it easy for donors to connect with frontline aid organisations, understand the needs on the ground, and get their aid delivered.

## 📅 Upcoming Events

You can find announcements of upcoming free open-source coding events on [our Open Collective events page](https://opencollective.com/distribute-aid-usa/events). We have two event formats: Livestreams and Code Jams.

### Livestreams

Join [Taylor](https://twitter.com/borderless_dev) and [Ramón](https://twitter.com/hola_soy_milk) every Thursday at 10:30am PST / 1:30pm EST / 7:30pm CEST. We pair up each week to hack on [Distribute Aid's landing site](https://github.com/distributeaid/distributeaid.org) and discuss what's happening at the intersection of humanitarian aid and open source tech. You can [catch us on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/DistributeAid)!

### Code Jams

Our Code Jams are a great way to find out what open-source at Distribute Aid is all about and make your first contribution! It's a mix of office hours and pair programming hosted by [Taylor](https://twitter.com/borderless_dev). The times vary so we can include folks from all around the world. Please note that you do have to register for these events, and will receive an email with a zoom link for the Code Jam at the end of the registration process.

## ⛑️ Contributing

The foundation of the refugee aid movement is built by
everyday folks putting in a few hours every week, and you should be proud to be
a part of it.

Through your work with Distribute Aid you will make it easier for hundreds of
aid workers on the ground to improve the lives of tens of thousands of
newcomers.

We're on track to save
refugee aid groups hundreds of hours and create hundreds of thousands of Euros
in value for the refugee aid supply chain every year!

We take a people-first approach at Distribute Aid, and will do our best to match
you up with work that fits your skill set and interests. Please introduce
yourself in [our Slack](https://distributeaid.github.io/slack-invite-link/) and
which technologies you are familiar with as well as how much time you are
willing to commit for your contributions.

We'll match you with one of our tech leads to get you started on your first
contribution on one of our tech projects.

But first, please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/distributeaid/.github/blob/saga/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### 📋 Needs Assessment

> <https://github.com/distributeaid/needs-assessment>  
> <https://github.com/distributeaid/needs-assessment-storage>

The goal of this project is to provide a way for Distribute Aid to run needs assessment using forms that can be modified using low-code or zero-code approach. These forms need to provide validation and flow logic.
